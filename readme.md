# Quantum Mechanical Keyboard Firmware

## This is an outdated version of QMK firmware which supports Leeku L3 PCBs (Finger 60, 65, TKL) only!
Requires chibios, chibios-contrib, googletest, and ugfx folders in qmk_firmware-leeku/lib (they can be empty). That is, after cloning repo, mkdir -p qmk_firmware-leeku/lib/chibios

Build using: make l3_finger65:nug
